Bumble,"Hey y’all. First time OP here! 

I’m genuinely curious for those of us (eg me) who find this as an issue. I know the apps are designed to be addicting, too. How do you deal with it? 

I live alone, bout 5 months out of a serious, long term relationship, and I find the dating scene to be fun and enjoyable. Unfortunately, I think I’m depending on it a little too much as entertainment and self esteem. 

I’m working on setting boundaries, being intentional with when I use or don’t use the apps (bumble and hinge) but I’m having trouble being disciplined. 

I’m quite emotionally intelligent and self aware, and I’d rather feel like I can get to a good place on this than either continuing to ‘struggle’ or even deleting them for a couple months so the temptation isn’t there and it’s easier to focus on myself. 

What do y’all think? Anyone feel this? Thanks!",How do you deal with the addictive nature of OLD?,"Hey y’all. First time OP here!

Bumble,"Hello redditors,
Today I bring you a piece about my recent experience on bumble. I downloaded the app many moons ago and met a girl on it, we entered into a relationship and the app was a success... but then I got dumped a few months later. Tragic though it may be, it took me a few weeks to muster up the strength to go back to bumble, to just try and meet new people. I saw something with this girl so I fully deleted my account. And i had to make Andrew one when I redownload it. Although it had been months, I have gotten zero (0) matches even though I believe my profile is better than my last. I deleted and reinstalled the app without deleting my account. And... nothing... I used to get about 1 or 2 likes a day. But now, nothing.
This brings my to my question. 1) am I shadow banned?
2) if yes, why? And does it expire?
3) what can I do about it?

Bumble,"Alright ladies... having trouble getting dudes (if that's your thing) to swipe on you, or even carry out a conversation past ""hey how was your day?"" or ""wyd?"" well might be time to have a peek at that profile and look for some of these potential problematic scenarios that I (being a straight mixed male in his late 20s) look for and immediately fling your ass to the left of my screen. This isn't intended to shame or cause drama. This is just my $0.02 that you can either ignore, or consider maybe. You can feel free to add your takes or rebuttals below if you'd like.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Having ONE picture of yourself and it's an up close shot of the side of your face and I can literally count the pixels due to the poor resolution. It's 2020, there's no excuse not to have at least a few you can pop out onto your profile. 

\- Your instagram or snapchat link and nothing else. We get it, you want to be internet famous. Not decent dude wants that level of narcissism. Bad form. Send me that shit after we get talking if you're just in it for followers, and no we don't buy that BS line of ""I never check this, add me here"" unless it's some desperate sweaty lad.    

\- You have more pictures of your pets, memes or scenery than you do of you. This kinda combines the first two. You got like 8 or 9 squares and a small bio area to 'sell' yourself to potential suitors. Make use of it. No one is on this app to check out your filters and landscape snaps. Save it for the deviant art account. 

\- Which brings us to the next point, DON'T OVERUSE FILTERS. Some of you are either really enamored with filters or really self-conscious that you have to adorn every selfie you take with puppy dog ears and a cartoon tongue. This isn't cute. Save that for your nephew and niece when you're skyping them. We're good. 

\- Baggage is negotiable, as long as you're upfront with it. Got a kid or two? That's awesome, and I bet they're a hoot to hang out with, but could you disclose that up front? Some guys are perfectly ok with it, and being honest about that tidbit of info will get their attention. Trying to hide it though? That's gonna throw up red flags about what else you might be concealing. (This one is more of a long-game left swipe assuming you're not forthcoming with the details from the get-go.)

\- Group pictures... and nothing but group pictures... Once again, you're here to 'sell' yourself to potential suitors, and yet which one are you? If you're not telling us which one you are, how are we going to know? Are we just supposed to guess and hope you're the pretty one? That one's 100% unforgiveable. 

That's my small list of dealbreakers. I'm sure a lot of you are going to reply with ""No one asked"" or ""We don't care"" and that's fine, homie.

Hey everyone who happened to click this question!

I'm a guy, and I want to know what makes bios good or bad. In the past I talked about what I do and my passions cause I think they're pretty unique and interesting (I work on design for theme parks). But I never got much success.

Do you think putting your job as the focus of your bio turns people off? Like it makes them think you aren't fun and all you do is work? I didn't put a lot of what I like to do ""playing videogames, hanging out with friends, driving around listening to music"" cause I assumed that was boring and what everyone else puts. But are bios that are more low key and more ""I love to do X, and I'm looking for X in a girl/guy"" a better template for a bio than a cool job/hobby?

Bumble,"Hey everyone! Ive been dating this guy for over two months now, things have been going great. From the very beginning I asked what his intentions were and he said he was looking for a relationship, cool me too. He’s expressed he’s really into me and has been consistent in talking to me through out the day. About a month ago I asked him if he was dating anyone else and he said no, he’s “only interested in me”.  I just wanted to know because COVID and because I didn’t want to get too attached but he assured me he wasn’t. I regularly check his profile to see if he’s updated anything, the other day I saw he updated his pictures so it was a red flag. I confronted him about it and he said he did that a while ago before things got serous between us, I asked if he wanted to see other people and he said no and deleted his bumble. 

So my question is, 

Since I have been checking his bumble on a regular basis I don’t see how he did that a while ago. Is he lying about that? Or could he have maybe be telling the truth but he logged out before the photos fully uploaded and once he logged back in they completed and that’s when I saw the change? Or am I reaching?

-Don't compliment the woman on looks right away (or possibly at all) unless she gives you an indication otherwise.
-Do not bring sex unless she gives you an indication otherwise.

-Focus on humor, witty conversation, and flirting
-Don't force small talk.

(M31) I've been on Bumble, Hinge &amp; Tinder about 4 months now. I'm aware this may be relatively short compared to some people but i thought i would jot down some of my takeaways from this strange and complicated area of the internet.

**Ghosting Happens, a lot...** Ive had around 70 matches between my 3 accounts, not massive but not entirely insignificant. Over half my matches have not even bothered to chat. One could say ""oh you didn't have a good enough opener"" but i think it goes beyond this. Don't take this to heart, internet dating is rough and given the window shopping nature of swiping apps, feelings can change in an instant.

**Matching is just the beginning** When i first starting getting matches i was over the moon thinking ok this is going well. Spoiler alert, im still single... Matching is relatively insignificant on the grand scale of things its just the foot in the door, you have to do the rest.

**Getting attached too early &amp; Manage expectations** I met 2 girls who i started to develop feelings for, its safe to say i was actively dating them for a while having various meets with continuous conversation over the space of a few weeks. These both ended with me having that empty feeling and questioning what the fuck happened. Both times things began to get semi serious and ghosted. Without the proper context, it can be speculated that i done several things wrong i.e coming on too strong, shit banter etc especially posting on a dating forum...

**Carrying the conversation** This would happen a lot, 95% of people i had engaged with just didn't have good chat and would just give me 1 to 2 word answers to every question i pose. The classic ""tell me about yourself, Hobbies, likes, dislikes etc"" would often result in ""what you wanna know"" (im sure people will pick that apart...). Im not claiming to be a master at text, its more to the point that there needs to be some engagement between the two of us, i mean its a dating app afterall. This doesn't define them as a person, but in a dating app where everything relies on communication through messaging its hard to overlook. With that said, i have met some genuinely interesting people and had some really great convos, they are just few and far between.

I can think of a few more but ill leave it there. My situation is entirely subjective and as i imagine people will point out, they dont know my profile, see my chat and or type of matches as well as my area im in as this can massively impact the amount of matches one can get. Maybe im the problem, im not ruling anything out but I hope fellow redditors take something away or at least can relate.

So I matched with a girl I thought was really pretty, didn’t look at her age. I just turned 22 and then found saw she was 18.

Bumble,"I am a (visibly) minority woman in her 20s in the USA who is currently on apps, and I had some thoughts that I wanted to put out there, and get some input on. I hope I don't sound like I am offending anyone, but I just wanted to see what is going on here and if I am overthinking?

To be blunt...I notice that when I match with a non-white guy, 9/10 he will ask me questions that make it seem like he is genuinely interested in getting to know me, we will be sending long paragraphs back and forth, I don't feel like I am the only one contributing to the conversation/pulling teeth, they will actually ask for a date/Facetime, etc. Basically, it's easy, and I never have to doubt whether he is interested in me or not.

Otoh, whenever I match with a white dude, 9/10 the following happens:

* The first message he asks is, ""Where are you from?"" When I answer Wisconsin (cuz that really is where I am from), they will express how surprised they are and follow with, ""Where is your family from?""
* The conversation will feel super...one-sided, in that I end up realizing I am the one asking all the questions and keeping the conversation going whereas he is just answering and never asking me about myself (unless it's to ask if I am interested in coming over). Or if the topic of meeting up ever comes up, they ghost, even if the conversation did make it seem like they were interested.
* The guy will immediately jump to talking about my looks to mention how I look so ""interesting"" and ""unique"" and ""exotic"", or the conversation will turn sexual really fast

Basically, any white guy I have ever matched with rarely seemed serious about getting to know me.

Although I do manage to come across plenty of guys that seem to care to make a genuine effort (like I mentioned in my second paragraph), I live in a white-majority area (like &gt;80% white). As a result, it just *seems* like I mostly get the type of encounters I listed above, making dating seem super discouraging altogether. So I guess my question here is...am I overthinking things by relating all this to race? Has any other woman of color noticed/experienced this? How do I proceed on apps then?

Bumble,"I joined Bumble a few months ago and I feel like I don't know anything about dating someone who I met on a dating app :( So here I am asking for advice.

I recently started seeing a guy. It's been like 3 weeks but we spent a lot of time together since he stayed over at my place last week, entire week.

His work got really really busy this week (long story short but this is 100% true). Anyway our weekend plan got cancelled. We also planned to spend Thanksgiving together (we both live far from our parents) but he said he's not sure anymore because of his work.

I know he's not seeing anyone and neither am I. But his texts are far less engaging (used to be super engaging) and everything feels off, like he doesn't respond much to my flirty texts, which was not the case before lol

Also, I said he can still come to my place over the weekend and work here like last week but he said no. He's still texting me but mostly about how stressed he is from work.

Should I ask him directly if he wants to keep seeing me or should I give him some room first?

Bumble,"Let’s backstory this.

So I got out of a bad relationship not that long ago. He was very emotionally abusive, frequently gaslighting, manipulating and belittling me. I have no wounds to heal. I’m good - I’m not deeply traumatized or suddenly damaged goods - nothing like that. I got out of it and have only seen the brighter side of things because of our breakup. I am somewhat hesitant to approach the idea of a relationship. It’s been two back to back bad relationships for me. Just think I need to take a step back.

–

Back to the present. Let’s call him Jake!

Jake and I matched three weeks ago. We have been talking consistently, every day, and they’re like...full screen length texts. He never hits me with a simple one liner. We’ve FaceTime’d twice and both times for hours. And yes we’ve met in person! Anyway, two weeks ago, I had told him that I’m not really sure what I want right now and that if he wants to just keep talking, I’m cool with that but if he doesn’t, that’s fine, too. Gave him a way out. He said he wanted to keep talking because I’m fun to talk to.

I’ve kind of been the flakier one. I’ve had to kill our plans to hang out twice now. The first time was actually more because he was occupied with family and I suggested we just postpone. The second time, I was writing a paper that was taking awhile. He suggested we FaceTime after I’m done with my paper and I was down for it. We ended the call with me tucked in and ready to go to bed. After the second time we FaceTimed, I kind of started feeling a change in how I felt? But of course, I’ve never met him in person yet, right? We then made plans to reschedule to the following weekend (this weekend).

I went out this week and got a little hammered. Okay, a lot hammered. I had a great time, I puked, I went home. It was awesome for newly single “have been trapped in a relationship for too long” me. Not sure what compelled me but I shot out a few texts in reply to some of the people I’ve been “loosely talking to” about my night being drunk and dumb. One of them was Jake. My last text read, “now I’m dying.” Every other guy had responses along these lines: “Thanks for the invite! Wish I was getting drunk with you. You seem like fun to be drunk with.” Okay cool.

But not Jake, NO! He texts asking if I’m okay and if he needed to take me to get something to eat, and when I didn’t respond for a few minutes, he called me to check up on me. Long story short there: he ended up bringing me food and eating with me. We stayed in the living room the whole time, chatting, hanging out, eating, listening to music together. He was just every bit of awkward, cute, sweet and goof I imagined. When we said goodbye, we hugged and he hugged me so tight that I just felt a little flutter in my heart about it.

TL;DR. Sort of closed the door to dating with a guy early but have been changing my mind as I keep talking to him and after we met. Not sure if he’s also interested though?",Do I (25F) shoot my shot with (27M)? Need help reading the room.,"Let’s backstory this.

So I got out of a bad relationship not that long ago. He was very emotionally abusive, frequently gaslighting, manipulating and belittling me. I have no wounds to heal. I’m good - I’m not deeply traumatized or suddenly damaged goods - nothing like that. I got out of it and have only seen the brighter side of things because of our breakup. I am somewhat hesitant to approach the idea of a relationship. It’s been two back to back bad relationships for me. Just think I need to take a step back.

–

Back to the present. Let’s call him Jake!

Jake and I matched three weeks ago. We have been talking consistently, every day, and they’re like...full screen length texts. He never hits me with a simple one liner. We’ve FaceTime’d twice and both times for hours. And yes we’ve met in person! Anyway, two weeks ago, I had told him that I’m not really sure what I want right now and that if he wants to just keep talking, I’m cool with that but if he doesn’t, that’s fine, too. Gave him a way out. He said he wanted to keep talking because I’m fun to talk to.

I’ve kind of been the flakier one. I’ve had to kill our plans to hang out twice now. The first time was actually more because he was occupied with family and I suggested we just postpone. The second time, I was writing a paper that was taking awhile. He suggested we FaceTime after I’m done with my paper and I was down for it. We ended the call with me tucked in and ready to go to bed. After the second time we FaceTimed, I kind of started feeling a change in how I felt? But of course, I’ve never met him in person yet, right? We then made plans to reschedule to the following weekend (this weekend).

I went out this week and got a little hammered. Okay, a lot hammered. I had a great time, I puked, I went home. It was awesome for newly single “have been trapped in a relationship for too long” me. Not sure what compelled me but I shot out a few texts in reply to some of the people I’ve been “loosely talking to” about my night being drunk and dumb. One of them was Jake. My last text read, “now I’m dying.” Every other guy had responses along these lines: “Thanks for the invite! Wish I was getting drunk with you. You seem like fun to be drunk with.” Okay cool.

But not Jake, NO! He texts asking if I’m okay and if he needed to take me to get something to eat, and when I didn’t respond for a few minutes, he called me to check up on me. Long story short there: he ended up bringing me food and eating with me. We stayed in the living room the whole time, chatting, hanging out, eating, listening to music together. He was just every bit of awkward, cute, sweet and goof I imagined. When we said goodbye, we hugged and he hugged me so tight that I just felt a little flutter in my heart about it. He also tried to secure our next little meeting and said, “I’ll see you...Saturday?” Aakfjfiekdkwkws

Bumble,"Just wanted to post my success story to give some people hope. Back in February I was healing after finally escaping an abusive relationship. I had started a new job right when Covid hit and ended up losing it due to layoffs, which sent me into a depression on top of everything I had already gone through. For seven months, it was pretty rough. I suffer from bipolar disorder and pretty much became unglued. Multiple interviews later, I finally got a job in August and when I started getting my life back on track I decided to join Bumble. I actually elected to utilize Bumble's premium features, which means that I saw everyone who had swiped right on me and got to pick who to match with. After many failed attempts at making a connection and one short-lived fling, I finally saw someone that caught my eye.


I matched with him. At first he seemed a bit uninterested, we both took a bit to respond to each other. I chalked it up to the app being buggy on notifying us of a new pm. After two days of this, I finally asked for his number. (It should be noted that I am rather blunt and to the point)


We talked for about two weeks before we set a date to meet up. He lives an hour north of me, so I went straight from work which shortens the journey by about twenty minutes. We ended up shifting the date a day early because we were so excited to meet up. 


I showed up at his place (I know that seems forward, and no it was not expected to just be a hook-up. It was a date.) and basically just planted myself in his life. He says he is happily along for the ride. It's been almost 3 months, he's met my parents and my pets, and I see him every week. Let me tell you, he is absolutely worth the gas and the trip. (I go to him because my parents are super old-school hispanics and despite me being 26 they expect us to be within their view and not too close while at my place. Ergo, we go to his place since he lives alone.)


He doesn't know I had Bumble premium, so he doesn't realize that I specifically chose him and it wasn't a matter of coincidence that we matched up. I'm so happy to have met him. He is understanding, kind, we geek out together and have a standing Mandalorian date to watch the new releases. I know a lot of people would say ""It's just three months!"" but he's just a genuinely good person and we fit together pretty well. Plus my pets and parents approve, so that's good.


We've already been through a rough patch because of my bipolar disorder. It wasn't fighting but I had a severe depressive episode and he was there for me the whole way through. He has never judged me and always reminds me he's there for me. I truly found a good one.

Bumble," I'm gonna try and condense this as much as possible.

We had just established that we live somewhat close to each other and I figured maybe it would be a good opportunity to suggest we meet in person. It was something along the lines of ""We should meet in person, if you would be open to that"". It was probably way too early to though, as we had only exchanged like 10 lines at this point. I decided to shoot my shot cause she seemed interested and I've had far too many convos drag on until my match loses interest. Anyways it seemed to have scared her off cause she did not respond. I was gonna give it 24 hours and send a follow up but when I went on Bumble the next day she deleted her account. For sure deleted and not unmatched. I just chocked it up to ""you live and learn"" and to not be so direct so soon. Figured if I saw her on the app again or at a show I would just try again. BUT 2 weeks later, yesterday specifically, I came across her profile on IG. Its private but I can tell its her for sure. So, it would be weird if I tried to follow her right?

Bumble,"If I see a dude who says he smokes in his profile, I swipe left no matter what. I wish Bumble had an option to filter profiles by “without”. That said, I truly appreciate the guys who put the badge in their profile, because it keeps us from wasting time.

I have asthma and really bad allergies. I’m not even judging people’s life choices here. I just can’t be around it if I enjoy breathing, which I do. I’m on like four medications daily for my allergies, symptoms still suck, and there’s a good chance I’ll need surgery on my sinuses. So I don’t think I’m being a judgmental pansy.

I understand why people don’t put political/religious filters (because honestly if you just have a label people are gonna make probably not true assumptions), but I don’t see a reason why people don’t use the “smokes” one. If someone enjoys smoking, I’m not going in with the assumption they’ll change, because that’s not fair to them.

Just some thoughts from a gal who enjoys breathing 🤷‍♀️

Edit:

This got more attention than I thought. People are pointing out that I am trying to date as a high-risk person in a pandemic. I don’t go out willy-nilly, and when I do, I wear a mask and I social distance. Everything is a calculated risk. To be honest, meeting at a public park with masks on, etc. is less of a risk than going to the grocery store, in my opinion. Plus, a lot of people have been doing FaceTime and such to make sure they’re really interested before meeting in person, limiting in person contact.

I am an optimist and think, eventually, this pandemic will end. When it does, my high-risk status will not be such a big deal.

However, I will not expect a man to change for me—i.e. stop smoking— and I’m assuming the habit would continue after a limited period of time. It wouldn’t be fair to him or me to expect or need that.

I would feel this way outside a pandemic as well. The pandemic is a risk, but to me, smoking is another known one. You do you, I don’t really care, I just don’t want to set myself up for failure.

Also, I love cats, but have a severe allergy to them too...so when a dude has a bunch of pics with his cat, that’s a left swipe too. I’d be a crazy cat lady if I could, so this really has nothing to do with judgment on my part.","I really appreciate guys who use the filters for smoking, so consider this.","If I see a dude who says he smokes in his profile, I swipe left no matter what.

Bumble,"Saw video ad for bumble for the first time, only had one YouTube comment so seized the moment.

Nice vid Bumble, could you add a ""superlike"" feature? And I know the female making the first move is your ""shtick"" but women don't initiate beyond ""hey,"" because there is little incentive if they don't really like their match. 

Adding a feature for guys to add prompts (like the Hinge model of conversation starting,"" so girls can more easily break the ice if they are nervous(as is not the standard for apps) and/or will prompt women who (almost only) start the convo with ""hey;""  to say something like   ""hey nice cat."" Because the prompt is a photo of the guy holding a cat or a prompt that reads, ""Proud Cat Owner and Rescuer 'cause cats rule dogs drool.""  

 This would cut down on the disproportionate artificial bias this app has for females and help them be disinhibited and shy anxiety wise. Not a problem for guys as much but would still help them as well: for the same reason plus weeding out the amount of matches in your beeline that all just say ""hey.""

 Women don't need to make an interesting bio as much as male users in order to achieve more matched profiles.   

""also adding filters for height and weight (hidden algorithmically) and verifictcation for such would help stop people getting deceived all the time""  (donut put a paywall on this pls)

Bumble,"I (23F) matched with a guy (26M) on Bumble, and we went on a nice first date to an art museum and grabbed tea.

Anyways, everything seemed positive except for when I checked their location on Bumble before our date to see if they were heading up to campus.

We've gone on about 7 dates/hangouts that were simple, sweet, and filled with great conversation. I got him to try new things. I'm filled with mixed emotions when I'm around him, but in a good way. Not to sound cheesy, but each time I see him I get butterflies like I'm meeting him for the first time again. However, there hasn't really been any physical contact. Which is confusing to me. He hugged me a few times and we did have sex on the fourth date ( it was also very random and I intiated that... I had sex, not complaining. It's been 5 years). I'm afraid to make a move beyond that, because I don't want to scare him away (I really want to kiss him). He does ask about my schedule and intiates when it comes to making plans and makes the time to spend time with me around his busy schedule and I move mine around too. A few times when we were together, he has mentioned that he doesn't plan on staying here and wants to move. I'm sure his mind is pretty much set and that has honestly stalled me from making any additional moves in fear of being rejected or having my heart broken. I like him alot, but each time I leave him, I feel stupid or as if I'm wasting my time chasing something because he won't be here long and also the lack of physical contact leaves me confused. I love spending time with him and just thinking about him makes me smile. I love trying to figure him out. He's an interesting guy and seeing him so passionate about things is amazing. I want to ask how he feels, but I don't want to scare him away... I also want to try to figure it out a bit myself first. 
I guess I'm asking if I'm crazy... how would you interpret the interest level? Should I voice my concerns or just try to enjoy the ride? My emotions have been all over the place. I haven't really dated in years. The last date I went on was a ""pigging,"" so I'm really caution when it comes to dating.

TLDR? I would hate to just walk away, but I'm having doubts. He seems interested, but there's not been much physical contact and a 99% chance he's leaving.",Please help me.

Bumble,"A month and a half ago, I matched with someone on bumble. It started off really slooooow. Took about 1 week to get past the initial messages. After that, it became rapid fire. It was literally one of those things where the conversation was flowing between different things and i shit you not, every topic it touched on there was an extreme amount of commonality across both parties.

Anyway, we exchange some social media and , she gives me her number, apparently i took too long to ask. And well I mention something which she asks about. I brush it off with a joke and change the subject.

That was the last time I heard from her. Purged me from social media etc.

I've been a quite a few video chats and a couple of dates since and never found that special chemistry/spark.

Anyway, fastforward to today, I'm clearing all my old messages and i run across hers. I wonder to myself what happened, and wondered if on bumble or somewhere else I had done/said something. So i send her a message apologizing for whatever I may have done, and wishing her the best.

She responds telling me that basically, brushing aside the question kinda killed the connection for her and wishes me the best. I let her know what the real answer was, ""for the record"". She gave a reaction to it. 

Obviously in the moment, i didn't really think too deeply about the question, but in hindsight, what she was asking about could essentially be construed as a major red flag, and i guess that since we were still just at the texting stage, she wasn't invested enough to push for the real answer. 

And by major red flag, that question essentially could point towards me trying to cheat on my SO, or trying to actually cause harm to the woman from bumble. Obviously in the moment that i played it off as a joke, it didn't dawn to me what it really could mean.

Kinda sucks, at the same time, I guess it wasn't meant to be.

While I'm sure 99% of people realize this pre-first date text messaging, you probably want to be careful what you say.  IRL, this is similar to a joke I'd usually make and context and my demeanor is enough that noone thinks much of it. But with someone who you are still a stranger to and may not get all the ""extra"" stuff over text , it might have a pretty negative effect.",Just wanted to share my story as a warning for others,"A month and a half ago, I matched with someone on bumble.

Bumble,"Hi, first time poster here. I downloaded Bumble a year ago and I’m almost over it. I bought the lifetime membership before I realized this may not be the best app for me. I live in an urban zip code so I thought finding single guys within a 10 mile radius of me wouldn’t be an issue. Every time I swipe through Bumble I see mostly white suburban and country guys. Very few non white guys and very few city men. With the premium membership I can see who has already swiped right on me and it’s almost all white guys on tractors, holding up bass, wearing MAGA hats.

Bumble,"This is just something I need to get off my chest. To hopefully help other people out there. I went out on a date Saturday night, the guy was nice, actually he was great and very sweet. But by 10:30 pm everything became a blur and this scares me. I know the guy I went out on a date with didn’t do anything to me, if anything he was worried and he thought that maybe I took something other than alcohol. This has never happened to me before, and I put myself in danger with someone I didn’t even know. It’s Tuesday and I still don’t know what happened, I don’t remember how I got home, I remember bits and pieces and how I felt so lost and confused. My step brother believes someone could’ve spiked my drink, I personally don’t want to think that. I knew the guy I met didn’t do that.

It is Tuesday and after what happened Saturday I haven’t been able to do school or even walk my dog. I feel so down and so confused. That shouldn’t have happened. My family and my friends all called me through out the day yesterday and today to just talk and try to make me feel better. I feel numb, something could’ve happened to me, someone could’ve taken me, I put myself in danger and I don’t know how that happened. 

The guy I went out on the date with, told me to never do that again to someone else, he said he was confused and asked me if I had taken anything when I went to the bathroom or something. I don’t do drugs, not like that, I don’t even smoke weed, I have done micro dosing with shrooms before, and have tried things before but I don’t go out to bars and take drugs. He didn’t understand how scared I am from what happened Saturday, so I tried to tell him and now we left it at that. I was apparently talking nonsense, he was worried and confused. He texted me so that I could explain and be honest, which I tried to explain but how am I supposed to explain what happened? 

What I just have to say is, be careful with what you drink, not just with a date but with everyone around you. This have never happened to me before, the fact that I can’t remember anything from 10:30pm until about 5 am is just not normal, everything being a blur, remembering being confused and lost. Sunday I didn’t even feel real. It scares me, it scares me that I went out and something could’ve happened to me and it happened suddenly and fast. I had nobody waiting for me at home, nobody to take care of me. I had to call my mom at 5 am to come help me because I was confused. I did not feel sick at all, no hang over, just a massive head ache and just tired. I slept all day and then by the afternoon I was fine.

Bumble,"Hi! I have been on this subreddit quite a bit lately, and after browsing through many complaints on here (and some success stories) I thought I'd share my experience from the female side of things, and tips (as in, things I wish more guys on this app did) that might help you be more successful.   


The tips (the part most of you care about I assume):   
\-We actually appreciate profiles that contain personal details. 

When you blame women for starting a conversation with ""Hi"", take a moment to ask yourself--what does my profile have that she could use for a conversation? I only start conversations with ""Hi"" when the guy's profile had no information or his only hobby was cars/fishing and I had no desire to talk about that. 

\-If a woman starts with a ""hi"", don't give up.

 Try to have a conversation. She probably wasn't sure what to say to you from your profile or isn't naturally assertive. You can be a little random and gear the conversation into an interesting direction, don't be too obsessed with being ""normal""--that's boring.   


\-What kind of details should you include? 

Your hobbies, how you spend your time, what you do for fun, your favorite shows/movies, a good memory you have so that the convo could start off with a fun story you have to share, etc. A funny joke/witty line to describe yourself is a bonus because it makes you seem fun and playful. 

 \-Even if you aren't super hot, put a good photo of \*your face\*

If you're insecure about your looks, putting 3 pictures of you standing far away isn't going to get you a match--we still want to know what you look like. Yes--this app is unbalanced and less attractive women shoot for hot men. But, we run out of them and if we're not hot enough we ain't getting em anyways, so eventually we will see your profile, and if you're a cute six with a QUALITY picture, you'll get that swipe. If you don't have a good picture, take a good selfie. A lot of the cute girls you see took 34 selfies to get the cutest one, even if you're less used to trying so hard, do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My story:   
I, like many of us here, downloaded the up in quarantine boredom hoping to meet some people. I'd rate myself as average looking, definitely not the supermodel type but I think you'd say I'm cute. The rest is a bit of the classic story. Initially, the app did not disappoint. I would get the nicest profiles and a match on almost every like. Of those matches, most of the conversations ended up being rather boring (and I started the conversation with anything but ""hi"" believe me) and many of the guys weren't putting effort into the conversation, so then I'd stop texting them. Over my two months on the app (I wasn't using it too religiously, maybe once in a couple of days),  I had a few good conversations, exchanged my number with 6 guys, and been on dates with 2. I liked the first one a lot, we went on three dates, but ultimately it didn't work out because we lived too far apart and I guess he wasn't into me enough to put in that kind of effort. The second guy was very sweet, I could tell he was really into me, but I realized I don't connect with him on a personal level so after our second date I told him this wasn't gonna work. Since then, matches have gotten worse, sometimes I get a nice profile that I appreciate but most of them are garbage (and not necessarily bc of the looks) so I'm starting to become discouraged. I wish more guys had profiles with actual personalities because I'd be happy to be with someone interesting, even if he isn't the sexiest chad out there.

Last night the most beautiful girl i had ever seen, swiped right on me and messaged me, saying i have a nice smile.

I was Don Jon in.... Don Jon, seeing Scarlet Johansson for the first time. 

I should have waited and composed myself, but instead i wrote back a cheesy, corny, goofy, cancerously bad response about her smile.

I didnt want to push it, so i thought i would let her respond and then try to salvage the conversation. 

I waited and waited. I kept looking back at her profile. I forgot to respond to all the other messages as i just couldnt stop thinking of this girl. Then i got a little creepy and looked her up. She had a unique name so it was easy to find her Instagram and facebook. Thankfully both were private so i immediately hopped off.

I couldnt sleep at that point, so i went to check the app again. Tragedy struck. Her conversation was gone. She unmatched me. Why did i write that dumbass pickup line! I was devasted. OVER SOMEONE I NEVER MET!! Its ridiculous.

So now im stuck. I have her Instagram and her facebook. I barely ever use either.

Bumble,"24M. Been on maybe 10 OLD first dates in the last 6 months. One girl mentioned on Friday night how it took so long for me to ask her out that she started to doubt whether I was into her. Got me thinking because I feel like the opposite (rushing to ""let's grab a drink"") can be even worse, yet I've seen people on this sub complain that ""Hinge guys just chat forever without any intention to meet up,"" so it's a tough balance to strike.  
  
My general ""formula"" if you want to call it that (obviously varies case-to-case) goes something like:

- message back and forth about 6-12 times in-app
- say they should shoot me a text and leave my #
- wait for their text, then chat another 4-8 times
- suggest we grab a drink later that week/weekend, and figure out details from there  
  
Normally I'd say this takes course over maybe 2-3 days. Would you consider this a relatively long time to wait before suggesting we meet up? It seems like I get ghosted if I bring it up too quickly, and especially so if I bring it up in the app instead of over text. But if girls prefer I be more direct and to-the-point, I'm fine with that as well. Any thoughts appreciated!","Girls, how long do you expect to chat before being asked out?","24M.

Bumble,"Hey,

Recently I have been using photofeeler to filter pics to help me have the best chances of getting matches, but I recently discovered that a low attractive score on photofeeler doesn't mean it won't be a good pic. 

For the longest time, I thought that your potential pic had to score a 8.5 attractive or better before testing it in your profile but I recently put a pic that scored a 7.2 attractive (20 votes) and I got way more matches all the sudden.

The kicker of it all, the picture I replaced scored an 8.2! And was done by a pro. 

However, you can still use photofeeler to isolate which pic out of a bunch of similar shots is the best one. For example, the pic above got a 7.2 but other during the same ""photoshoot"" got an average of 5s.

The most important takeaway is to keep cycling your pictures whilst only using photofeeler as a general guide to find out which one works the best for you. Photofeeler is not the gospel.",Photofeeler is not the gospel,"Hey,

However, you can still use photofeeler to isolate which pic out of a bunch of similar shots is the best one. For example, the pic above got a 7.2 but other during the same ""photoshoot"" got an average of 5s.

The most important takeaway is to keep cycling your pictures whilst only using photofeeler as a general guide to find out which one works the best for you. Photofeeler is not the gospel. Photofeeler is not the gospel",181

Bumble,"I (27M), have been using bumble/tinder for 2.5 years since my last long term relationship ended. There’s been a string of one night stands and short term things when I’ve always had “looking for a relationship” on my bios. 

Finally when I was about to give up, literally about to delete all apps for good, I found someone. Connected pretty quickly. 

I have been seeing my new girl, 24F, for 3 months now and it’s going fantastic. 

Guess I just wanted to say, don’t give up, it may be right around the corner for everyone! 

My advice is always: 
- meet up as soon as you can, or feel comfortable, texting for a long time always causes it to fizzle out 
- don’t be too keen, even if you feel like it’s going really well, match the pace of your partner 
- try to make her/him laugh, cliche but it’s the best way

Bumble,"
I (M19) have had dyed hair of various colors consistently for over two years now. However, now that my ex and I have broken up I am suddenly no longer in a stable position of not caring how people perceive me. I’ve been using dating apps (tinder and bumble) for two-ish months now and I have gotten very, VERY minimal results.

Both my exes assured me that I was attractive (and I work out quite a lot so I don’t have an unattractive body), but that does not seem to be correlating with success online. In the past month especially I’ve gotten maybe 2 matches, both of which unmatched me before a single word was spoken.

I’m starting to believe it’s due to my hair, because I’m not sure what else it could be. (I should be getting at least a few likes, right?) 

Because of this, I am debating whether I or not I should just cut off all my hair and return to my natural brown. 

What do you all think? Am I doomed with my current hair ?",Dyed Hair—death sentence for straight men on dating apps?,"

Bumble,"About a month ago a girl from bumble asked me out and we had a really nice date. Over the next few weeks we talked everyday and she asked me out a couple more times and and we went on some more dates. Overall, things seemed to be going well: dates were fun, would always text me how much she enjoyed our dates or that she was excited to see me, and she would always be the one asking me out and planning our dates (mainly I think because I just moved here and she wanted to show me around and she would always ask me out immediately after our previous date before I got the chance to ask her out!).

She then had to cancel a date as she was having a bad day. One of her family members had been sick. She had been updating me on their condition over the previous week but I guess things were getting pretty bad. She said we should do something on the weekend tho, and then a few days later invited me over for diner and drinks the next night. However, she then texted me the next morning saying how she didn't think she was in the right place mentally to be dating with so much going on with her family, friends, and work - all things that she was telling me about previously which makes me think it was true. She then said that she just needed a bit of time to tackle everything on her plate but that she did really like me and enjoy hanging out, but that the timing just sucked and that maybe in a few weeks we could hang out if she was feeling better. 

I've gotten enough ""not the right time"" messages to know that it's usually just an excuse, but she made multiple posts on her instagram about needed time for self care and taking time off work, which makes me think she was being honest. I then just left it for a few weeks and planned to message her after a month or so to check in. 

Then yesterday, a little over two weeks since we last talked, she showed up on bumble again (previously deleted her account). I didn't swipe, just exited out of the app and left it lol. Part of me is is glad because it means she's probably feeling better, as well probably means she's feeling ready to date again. But part of me would have thought that if she was actually interested, she would have messaged me seeing as she seems to be looking to date again. 

So I'm trying to figure out what make of it all. I think if the roles were reversed, I may have still rejoined bumble, but I probably would have reached out to her too. Perhaps it means she isn't interested, but it seems odd considering how much interest she had been showing before. Maybe I should give her a few days, maybe bumble is sort of the first step of getting back out there, or maybe she's waiting for me to message her.

Bumble,"Background:

I was previously in a very toxic relationship for 4 years. After it ended I decided to take a break from relationships to focus on improving myself as it really affected my confidence and I also felt that if I was involved in a toxic relationship then I needed to improve personally and get more in tune with myself before dating again. I'm fairly healthy, could do with exercising more but I invest in a number of hobbies and things are good career wise. I'm always concerned that I'm not good enough though for another person but feel I can't get on like this forever and nearly two years on is enough time of focusing on self-improvement.

However, after the relationship ended I became a bit of a recluse then covid came around, I do have a great friend network but stopped going to parties and tended to just sit inside more and focus on my hobbies. Which I've found has brought me real stability and also my career which is doing well. But living alone also gets a bit lonely occasionally. 

By not partying I've also been disconnected with socialising or meeting potential partners or new friends and so it's been a while since I've had some indepth conversations with someone I liked. I've spent over half my life in relationships (I'm very monogamous in terms of dating and don't enjoy one night stands or having multiple partners for sex when not in a relationship) and while the self-improvement time was good, it would be nice to have a partner and experience the happiness again that comes from a relationship. 

From the isolation, I've exercised less and not been involved in the sort of activites that I see others post pics of in these apps. I'm happy enough with my appearance though but with there being so many profiles I'm a little thrown off. I also had a bad experience when Tinder first ever came out when a profile made negative comments about my longer hair.

Main question:

I've noticed when registering to apps like Bumble/Twitter it asks for multiple photos. To be honest I don't really have any photos of myself doing anything cool. I was up until recenty quite a well known DJ and there are some nice photos from then, but at the same time time this is something I'm trying to move away from due to the association with drugs and 3 day parties which is totally not me. But same time the photos show me at the peak of a hobby I pursued for a number of years mixing on vinyl.

I could take a selfie, but feel a bit awkward uploading 5 selfies. But the selfie would show exactly how I look.

There are good photos I have of me travelling, but in some cases these are 2-5 years old and I don't want to look different when meeting in person and coming across dishonest.

Really what I want to know is if I uploaded just a simple selfie photo that showed my face and appearance. No fancy pics of me posing in interesting places etc, would I still have a chance of meeting someone? Or am I better just waiting until I have some better photos. I also don't want to upload forced photos that dont really show who I am. 

Anyone been in a similar position or any advice/suggestions?

Thanks in advance.",Can you use these apps with a single photo or without a collection of non-adventurous ones? [M - Mid Twenties],"Background:

I want to have a more sexual encounters with women besides her, I really need this before I settle with her permanently to get it out my system

I need tips on how to use it and make my profile ,without her finding out How to use Bumble while in a relationship without getting caught",110

Bumble,"Is it the role reversal thing? Are my opening lines just awful?? Am I matching with guys “out of my league”? Are guys on bumble STRICTLY looking for a hook up and I come off too ‘relationship material’? What is it??? 

I have used bumble on and off for about a year now, and I can honestly say the guys on there have a RIDICULOUS sense of entitlement and are just plain rude. I’ve sent out some cute/creative messages and they almost act like “HOW DARE YOU EVEN MESSAGE ME??” They’re so cold, non-responsive, and it eventually fizzles out after a few exchanges. The craziest thing is I’ve actually sent some plain old “hey” messages to guys on there before and those worked better for me than sending something unique and different. 

Like just now I matched with this guy and my opening line to him was “you are so my type” (because he is) and he responded “whats your type”. Like it was so low effort of a response that he didn’t even include the question mark hahaha. I’m just like???? Like I’m pretty sure, from everything that I’ve read and learned about men, they really like to feel wanted right? Especially if they’re older, this guy is 38. Like I doubt he’s looking to play games of me playing hard to get and blah blah. So I made a comment that I thought would make him feel good and I meant it. 

And about what I said earlier about maybe I am matching with guys out of my league, but that’s not the case. I also have hinge and I get likes from guys on that app too and I would say the guys I’m matching with on bumble and on hinge are pretty much on the same level, like overall (looks, career, level of success - they’re very similar). But guys on hinge are so much more enthusiastic about reaching out and talking to me even if I’m the one giving them dry answers, they still keep trying, whereas guys on bumble could care less about any message I send them.   

Does anyone else have this issue too?","I have never met more rude, entitled men than guys on bumble.","Is it the role reversal thing? Are my opening lines just awful??

Tinder,"From my experience, girls in the United States are way more stuck up and entitled than in Mexico/Latin America (At least on Tinder).

And let me just clarify that when I say ""girls from the US"", I'm not just talking about white and black girls from just one part of the country, I'm talking about every ethnicity of woman in general who was raised in the US and has what seems to be this general american attitude of entitledness (obviously there are exceptions).

Now, I'm sure it's partially because I look different from the average person in latin america (being a black male who speaks spanish) so have that ""exotic"" look to stand out but even with that, it's just almost like night a day.

1. Most girls in Latin American twitter actually respond and hold a conversation. 

In my experience, Girls from the US, if you can manage to match with them in the first place, seem to refuse to put any effort in at all. You can literally be witty af in your openers and will often not even get as much as a ""hey"". 

Now, with my experience with latin american girls (mainly from Mexico), they have been much more open to getting to know you or at least talking and you I never had to send more than a ""hola"" or do more than make a general comment about something on their profile.

2. Latin American profiles tend to be a whole lot less ""entitled"" or about 50 different hoops you have to jump through to please them.

I have used tinder in many different parts of the US, from the south to the north, but one very common theme I've always seen in the average Tinder profile here is ""How great I am and these are all the requirements you have to do JUST so I can think about talking to you"". Even tho most of these girls are either overweight or single mothers (to be fair, a good number tinder users in latin america are single mothers too)  or just straight up not that attractive yet have such high standards.

On other hand, even tho you still do have some of the same hoop jumping profiles in latin america, then tend to be a lot less and most of the profiles I've seen were more about describing who they are personality wise and how they can be a good fit for you instead of what you need to do for them

3. Latin American girls are more willing to meet in person

A lot of girls from The US seem to have a big aversion to meeting up or use tinder strictly for validation and never have had any intention of meeting up.

The girls from Mexico and latin america on the other seem a hell lot more enthusiatic about meeting up (even the ones that I've met while they were visiting the US were more willing to meet up) and actually doing it. I've had more dates with just visiting a latin american country than I have with trying to meet girls in my local area.

Now, these were just a few obversations I made between the 2 different demographics of tinder.

Like I said, my experience is most likely way different than say a guy that was born and raised in these places just for that fact that I'm a foreigner and look different and go to trips instead of actually living there. So, I'm not trying to say it's tinder/dating paradise in these places. Women are women after all lol.

 And I'm also not saying I've never had any success with tinder girls from the US or that they're all as I described.

Tinder,"Guys and gals, would you ever feel bad or guilty if you ever led someone on? I'm a guy and was FWB with a girl who I ended up catching a lot of feelings for. She is known to be manipulative and toxic. 

I'm friends with some of her friends, and they have told me that she is emotionally confused, damaged, and can also be manipulative and toxic due to some of her past experiences. 

She did a number on me man, not gonna lie. I'm an attractive guy, I don't mean that in a cocky way but I could have ""multiple options"" if I learn how to just be comfortable in my own skin. She played countless games and used the fact that I liked her for an ego boost and attention. 

She is dating somebody now. Yet she still sends me random messages every now and then, including yesterday. She usually replies to my snap posts or sends me a photo of her wearing the t shirt I gave her. 

I play in a band and gave her one of our merch shirts, that's where that came from. It's just weird because we don't talk much anymore and she randomly slides in, while she is dating somebody. Wtf is she doing?

She told one of her friends that I know that she feels bad about what happened between us. However, I tried setting boundaries multiple times with her and it's like she found new ways to cross them. It really affected me, even more than I like to admit. 

If she feels so bad why didn't she ever tell me or apologize? She tells other people but not me. And also drops little breadcrumbs at me like she's trying to keep me around. It's all just weird.

Tinder,"So I’ve been talking to this girl for the past month and everything was going great until one day I made a joke about dogs being better than women because they’re low maintenance...it was a joke and she knows I have a really fucked up sense of humor because I’ve said jokes waaaay worse than that and she laughed at them. Anyhow, she took offense by it and said “You don’t like me. I get it”. 

I reassured her I liked her and that I was only joking, she wouldn’t respond back so I texted her the next day. We ultimately ended up arguing because she said that due to her past traumatic events she has a low self esteem (She was abused and raped in the past). I told her that I understood that but stated it wasn’t cool to tell me who I like and what I don’t like...if I tell you I like you and you tell me I don’t I take it that I’m perceived as a liar. I told her we can work things out, but that I’m not going to tolerate being told I’m a liar essentially. She said I was an asshole and ignored me, my last text was me pretty much ending the friendship by saying “If you don’t want to work things out then I guess goodbye”. 

So given this situation was I standing up for myself or being an asshole? I legitimately liked the girl, but I don’t think it’s acceptable to make false statements about someone and being able to rationalize it with past traumatic events. Idk you guys tell me what you think.

I matched a really cute girl Monday who was looking for ""nothing serious"". We chit-chat on the app the next couple of days and Wednesday morning I gave her my number.

I let her know I was looking for casual, maybe fwb but I wasn't sure if it would *really* go anywhere. I fell asleep early Wednesday night and woke up to a message (still on the app) from her around 1am asking if I was awake. Oops, oh well.

I got home last night about midnight and sent her a message (still on the app) telling her I just got home and asking if she was awake. I had barely hit Send when my phone buzzed.  It's her, half-drunk, giggly, at 12am on Thanksgiving. Looking for ""nothing serious"".

Fucking awesome, right? I wish.

We start doing the usual icebreaker thing, would you rather have one nipple or two belly buttons, who's the most interesting serial killer, etc. We're cracking jokes and hitting it off in a big way, but this is where I fucked up.

For some reason the conversation led to me telling her a story about a blackhead. I can't figure out how to post my screenshot, but I'll paste the text below.

ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE. I was enjoying the convo and talking to her like an old friend. Guys,this girl is a solid 8/10 and I never wanted her to be an old friend.

Anyway, here's the dumbest thing I've ever said. (in 2020):

ME:
Ooh. Mine is gross and amazing. 

HER:

ME:
 No. Way dumber.

I had a freckle on my nose that I thought was a blackhead from 12-16 years old. I would occasionally still test if I could squeeze it out, but it was permanent.

Until one day I squeeze and it moved. So I squeezed more until

It popped. But... When it popped, it flew out with enough velocity that it hit the mirror, ricocheted back, and hit me right in my open eye. It happened faster than I could blink.

Can anyone explain what's going on here? I've been pretty picky about my matches and not just spamming right-swipes. But as a test this morning I tried swiping right to 20 girls in a row, still not a single match.

Is the app just lying about likes to try and get me to sign up or something? 87 likes but not getting any matches?",121

Tinder,"There's a post on my profile that explains the story in full detail but it's pretty long so I doubt many people will want to read that haha. So I'm going to make it as short as I can. 

3 weeks ago, when we were still together, there was a tinder notification on my (now ex) boyfriend's phone.

 He claimed he downloaded it when we broke up a while back (we broken up for about a week) before getting back together. He said he never got around to deleting it and that the notification was just something like ""you have new faces to swipe on"" or ""you have a message waiting for you"". When I told him to show me the notification, he screenshotted a message sent out by tinder itself encouraging people to vote, sent that to me. I noticed it was a month old, and when I pointed it out he said that was the only thing it could be. As for how I saw the notification, I had seen it when he sent me a screenshot of something unrelated and the tinder icon was in the notification bar on his phone. We were also long distance at the time.

What are the chances that when we got back together, he truthfully never touched it despite being logged in still and just never thought to delete it even after 7 months? And is actually possible that the notification was really just ""you have a message waiting for you"" (which in that case would've been a reminder to check the message despite it being old), rather than being a match or message from a girl? According to a friend of mine tinder really does send out notifications like that when you're inactive until you delete it or turn it off.. but I don't know.

She messages “whats up?”  Shortly, after I message back “just relaxing hbu?”  She said “in bed laying down”. I reply “in bed at home?” She said “yes”. I didn’t believe it, so I asked again. 

Then she says she is with her friends at her fathers home which is far away, but I see her friends location on my Snapchat which is at her home. 

Therefore she lied twice.

I call and face time around 11:00pm and no reply. I see her active around on Instagram around 11:30 pm. I message and no reply. 

The next day I don’t receive a text/snap chat reply from her until around 12:30-1:00pm. I had a feeling something was up. So I go to her house and as I am driving she messages me “whats up?”  Shortly, after I message back when I arrive at her house and I told her “just relaxing hbu?”  She said “in bed laying down”. I reply “in bed at home?” She said “yes”.  I then send a picture that her car is not there. 

Then she says she’s at her friends, I drive to her friends place (who’s location is on Snapchat) and no car is there again. While her friend is at home. 

Therefore she lied twice.  

She then tells me she’s at a hotel/snaps me with a bunch of people guys and girls(around 6 people) who she met through a friend 2-3 weeks ago. She only knew the guys. The hotel is around 45-50 minutes away from her home. 

So I go to meet her and I see 1 of the girls and 2 of the guys. She says that the guys left that night and came back in the morning, which I think is B/S. 

I think she did things sexually with a guy &amp; slept at the hotel and didn’t want me to find out. 

What do you think you think she did/happened?",Woman seeing another/being with another man.,"Here’s my situation.

Tinder,"I \[28M\] went on a date with a girl \[29F\] we matched on hinge, spoke on whatsapp for about a week or so, really fun genuine chats, subtle flirting, nothing cheeky, we met for drinks, it went really well but as you can see from my history, I'm not long out of a relationship, anyway this girl asked me if we could go back to mine.

Anyway, so I saw her on tinder and her profile said ""no fuckboys, I want a serious man"", we matched and I was a bit perplexed, must have been an accidently swipe on her part so I sent her a whatsapp being like ""Sorry to intrude, but, what is it you wanted with me?
